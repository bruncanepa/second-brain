1/ Grade yourself against 3-5 core aspects of your job.
2/ Provide data that supports the grade.
3/ Send it to them and ask them to do the same.
4/ Now, here's the part that requires courage and finesse (depending on if they agree or disagree).
5/ Now once a month between now and promotion time: Send them an update. Show them how you stacked the wins and closed the gaps. Use metrics to quantify how you're moving the needle.

A typical update is along the lines of:

- One to two sentences about **something human**. Something that surprised me this week, something that energized me this week, something that made this week stand out for me
- One sentence summarizing any **key reminders** for upcoming deadlines or dates
- One paragraph for each **important topic** that has come up over the course of the week. These might be a quarterly planning update, a controversial tech spec, a product launch, a partner escalation, or any other topic that feels important. I usually pick 2 to 3 topics for each week
- A bulleted list of **brief updates**. These might be an incident review, a tech spec, a product design, an interesting discussion in chat, or anything else I want to create some visibility around
- Close with an invitation for folks to reach out with questions, thoughts, and concerns
