A typical update is along the lines of:

- One sentence summarizing any **key reminders** for upcoming deadlines or dates
- One paragraph for each **important topic** that has come up over the course of the week. These might be a quarterly planning update, a controversial tech spec, a product launch, a partner escalation, or any other topic that feels important. I usually pick 2 to 3 topics for each week
- A bulleted list of **brief updates**. These might be an incident review, a tech spec, a product design, an interesting discussion in chat, or anything else I want to create some visibility around
- Close with an invitation for folks to reach out with questions, thoughts, and concerns

1. **Hire and fire well**. Ruthlessly screen for culture fit. Prepare in advance what success looks like to you and the new hire. Let go of employees who are not high-performers.

2. **Create trust** with clarity, care, transparency and consistency.

## Onboarding

#### [Most companies suck at on-boarding new team members. Here's how to on-board yourself when starting a new job](https://mobile.twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1523316828164042753) by Wes Kao

1\. **Take charge of the process**. No one is as invested in your success as you are.
2\. **Start developing a point of view**. Write down: What you agree/disagree with,  Ideas that provoke a reaction, Questions & hunches
3\. **Review information with an active stance**. If you’re setting a meeting, think about how to make the best use of the time.
4\. **Gather what you need to suggest next steps**. There’s a difference between passive vs active observation. You should take time to absorb because you're learning the business, context, etc as a new hire.
5\. **Assume you’ll lead the meeting**. You behave differently when you’re a participant versus the meeting leader.
6\. **Identify the types of decisions you’ll make**. Knowing the type of decisions—and when you'll need to make them—helps focus your efforts.

**The 10 must-haves in an employee onboarding packet:**

1\. A personalized welcome letter
2\. Important passwords and log-in information
3\. Onboarding checklist and a company vision one-pager.
4\. Important HR paperwork
5\. Org charts and team structure
6\. Important training information
7\. Case studies, best practices, and applications
8\. A schedule for the first week
9\. Introductions to the people who are essential to them getting their job done
10\. Stories about the business that reveal how it came to be.

## Mentorship & Sponsorship

#### [WHAT DOES SPONSORSHIP LOOK LIKE?](https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/) By Lara Hogan

## Decision Making

#### [Cheat sheet to confidently make hard decisions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidkline_decisionmaking-playbook-leadership-activity-7024738918231089152-dEBy/) by Dave Kline

1\. Consider my level of confidence -> If high, I go fast.
2\. Determine the consequence of being wrong -> If fatal, I go slow.
3\. Expose the data and logic that supports my view -> Not exhaustive, only what matters.
4\. Seek alternatives perspectives open-mindedly -> Great thinkers and those with experience.
5\. Actively try on their opposing views -> Dismantle my prevailing choice.
